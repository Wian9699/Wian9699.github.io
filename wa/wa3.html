            <h1>Social Deduction Game</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>A social deduction game is a game in which players attempt to uncover each other's hidden role or team allegiance.[1] Commonly, these games are played with teams, with one team being considered "good" and another being "bad".[2] During gameplay, players can use logic and deductive reasoning to try to deduce one another's roles, while other players can bluff to keep players from suspecting them.
                <br>
                <br>
                Examples of social deduction games include Mafia, in which only the mafia know who is mafia and what the mafia players' roles are; Bang!, in which only the sheriff's role is known to everyone; and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Hitler">Secret Hitler</a>, in which only the fascists know who the fascists are, except for the player who plays as Hitler.[3] Other social deduction games include The Resistance, Deception: Murder in Hong Kong and Spyfall.
                <br>
                <br>
                Social deduction games have been adapted to video games numerous times through mods or full games. One instances of such adaptations are custom maps for StarCraft: Brood War including Changeling and The Thing.[4] These custom maps inspired later Warcraft III custom maps including Mafia, Werewolf, Zerg Infestation, and another Changeling and The Thing.[5] Other notable examples include Garry's Mod "Trouble in Terrorist Town" game mode,[6] Town of Salem, StarCraft II's Phantom Mode mod,[7] and Among Us.
                <br>
                <br>
                One important element of strategy in some social deduction games is determining how long to stick to one's story in the light of information obtained from other players.[8] A Monte Carlo tree search has been suggested for making decisions in social deduction games.[9]

    <h2 id="toc-botc">Blood on the Clocktower</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Blood on the Clocktower is a social deduction party game created by Steven Medway and published by the Pandemonium Institute in 2022.[1]
        <br>
        <br>
        Blood on the Clocktower shares core mechanics with Mafia, with a conflict between an informed minority (the evil team, made up of a Demon and Minions), and an uninformed majority (the good team, made up of Townsfolk and Outsiders). Each player is secretly assigned either a good or evil role and must help their team achieve its win condition. For the good team, this means executing the demon; for the evil team, this means eliminating players until there are 2 players alive. All actions are overseen by a Storyteller who conducts the player activities and makes important decisions</p>
    <br>
    <h3 id="botc-rules">Rules</h3>
    <p>Before the game begins, the Storyteller selects a script (or cast of characters), featuring anywhere from 21-25 characters, and determines which character roles will be in play for the game. Good players can either be Townsfolk, players with abilities which benefit the good team, or Outsiders, players with abilities which hinder the good team. Evil players can either be Minions, support for the Demon with abilities which hinder the good team, or the Demon, who has the power to kill during the night, and who must be killed for the good team to win. The number of Minions and Outsiders depends on the amount of players.[2]
        <br>
        <br>
        If a player is uncertain whether they can stay the entire game, or they enter late, they can play as Travellers with special abilities. Travellers can either be good or evil.[3]
        <br>
        <br>
        The game has two alternating phases: a night phase, during which players close their eyes and are woken one at a time by the Storyteller to gather information or perform actions; and a day phase, in which players socialize openly or in private, eventually resulting in a player's execution if a majority suspects them of being evil.[4]
        <br>
        <br>
        During the night phase, players cannot talk and actions are performed secretly. The Storyteller may give misinformation to players who are "drunk" or "poisoned". On the first night, Minions and the Demon learn who each other are.[5]
        <br>
        <br>
        During the day phase, players wake and can choose to either speak privately with each other or publicly in the "Town Square". Good players use social deduction and the group's collective information to deduce who the evil players are. Evil players can exchange information and bluffs, as well as spread misinformation among the good players. Dead players are never eliminated and can participate freely in discussions.[6] After an amount of time decided by the Storyteller, all players meet in the Town Square and have the opportunity to nominate players for execution. Execution occurs on a majority vote. Dead players each have one vote they can use for the remainder of the game. In most cases, the game ends when the demon is executed or there are only two living players remaining.
        <br>
        <br>
        There are currently three official scripts available from The Pandemonium Institute, which each come with their own roles and mechanics: "Trouble Brewing", "Sects & Violets", and "Bad Moon Rising".[3] The Pandemonium Institute is in development of an app version of the Town Square, which is currently in early access.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3 id="botc-reception">Reception</h3>
    <p>Development for Blood on the Clocktower began funding in 2018 with a successful Kickstarter campaign, which raised more than $570,000 USD, though it had already been in playtesting for years. During its development, the game was exhibited at various conventions and expos, including PAX 2018 and UK Games Expo 2018, and funds were raised for various "Clockwork Conventions" after its release.[3][7][8] It was adapted into a comedy show at the Old Red Lion Theatre in London, England in 2022.[9]
        <br>
        <br>
        During the Kickstarter campaign, Shut Up & Sit Down released a controversial video review in which Quintin Smith called it his “favorite game”.[10][11] A review for Wargamer described Blood on the Clocktower as the "all-round best social deduction game," stating that it "nails everything a great social deduction game needs, and it fixes many of the major problems the genre has."[6] The game won "Best Party Game" in Tabletop Gaming's 2022 awards.[12] Christopher Eggett, editor of Tabletop Gaming, praised it for its enjoyable gameplay and "longevity" due to the many roles and setups.[4]

    <p style="font-size: 14px; ">Image of movie poster for popular murder mystery movie from Rian Johnson, Knives Out</p>

    <p>The murder mystery fiction genre began in the first half of the nineteenth century. The party game, wink murder, dates back to at least the early twentieth century, and sees one player secretly selected as a murderer, being able to "kill" other players by winking at them. A killed player must count to five before dying, and the murderer tries to avoid detection.
        <br>
        <br>
        1937 saw the release of the first murder mystery game known as Jury Box.[2][3] In this game, the players or jurors are given the scenario of the murder, the evidence presented by the district attorney[2] and defendant, two photographs of the crime scene and ballot papers. After the players have made their decision as to who is guilty, the real solution is read out.
        <br>
        <br>
        Cluedo, or Clue in North America, was the first murder mystery board game,[2] where players race to identify a killer. It was released some time later in 1948, and has continued to be popular.
        <br>
        <br>
        The earliest form of role playing murder mystery games in a "How To Host" boxed format is in the 1980s. Back then the scenarios were typically simpler, the acting directions minimal, and the games relied on the guests being comfortable ad-libbing responses to each other's questions.
        <br>
        <br>
        In 1986, Dimitry Davidoff created the party game Mafia, where players sit in a room and a number of secret mafia members conspire to "murder" innocent players during eyes-closed night phases. This led to a genre of social deduction games where players attempt to uncover a secret subgroup.
