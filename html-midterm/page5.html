    <h3>Page 1</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Under the "This is a pagae filled with errors" paragraph, there is an ordered list and the item 3 list item doesn't have a closing tag of "/li", In order to change this I added the "/li" closing tag after it said "item 3".</li>
        <li>There is an image on page 1 with the alt: "An example image" where the src is not correctly linked to the image. I changed it from: "image.png" to "./img/image.png" which fixed it.</li>
        <li>There is a paragraph on this page that says: "This div contains a nested paragraph." that doesn't have a paragraph closing tag. I added the "/p" tag to the end of the sentence.</li>
        <li>There is a table within this page, and cell 3 doesn't have a closing tag for the table data. I added "/td" after it said "cell 3" to fix this.</li>
        <li>The table in this page doesn't have closing tags for the table, and the last table row. I added "/tr" then "/table" closing tags to fix this mistake</li>
    </ol>
